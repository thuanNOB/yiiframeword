# RealTime Chat Room with Node

This app is built with express.js and socket.io node modules. I use swig as templating engine.

## How to install

First clone this repo and then `cd` into it. After that run this command-

```
npm install
```

If you get some error the try with `sudo` permission. After install run the node server with this command-

```
node index.js
```

Then go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app.


## Building GUI
  [bootsnip](http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/like-hangout-chat)'s "Like Hangout Chat"  template is for GUI. Dummy avatar link is used, you may update as your wish.
